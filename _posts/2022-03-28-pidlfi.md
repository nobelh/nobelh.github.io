In this post, we’ll explore a technique to enumerate Linux processes through a web application vulnerable to LFI (Local File Inclusion).

File inclusion vulnerabilities allow attackers to read arbitrary files from local or remote systems and include the contents of the files in the web server’s response.

## A Vulnerable Web App
We'll use a simple php script to simulate our vulnerable web application. 
As shown in the following code, the `include` statement is used to copy into the `lfi.php` page, the contents of a file specified in the `lang` variable:

```php
<?php 
if(isset($_GET['lang'])){
        include($_GET['lang']);
} ?>ss
```

The following image shows a request/response to our web application, using the vulnerable parameter `lang` to read the `/etc/passwd` file:

## The proc Filesystem
On Linux, the `/proc` directory contains one subdirectory for every process running on the system. These subdirectories are named after each process ID number (PID) that is active.

Into the PID subdirectories we’ll find several files with information related to the specific process. As an example, to get the command line arguments used to start a service, we can read the `cmdline` file. In the following image, `980` is the PID for the Apache server process:

A full list of these files and it's purpose can be found [here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html).

## Enumerating PIDs with Ffuf
We'll create a number list and fuzz the PIDs with `ffuf`. Since all request returns a `200` status code, we'll use the `-fw 1` switch to filter responses with less than 2 words:  
```bash
for i in $(seq 1 5000); do echo $i >> pid.txt; done && \
ffuf -c -w pid.txt:FUZZ -u http://10.0.0.19/lfi.php?lang=/proc/FUZZ/cmdline -fw 1
```

Now we can read the `cmdfile` of any of the found PIDs. In the following example, we've discovered that on PID `4406`, the user `rgivens` is running a bind shell on port `65534`:

## Pythonizing the Process
I've created a python script to automate the process and write the contents of the extracted PID files into an output file for offline review. You can find the code **[here](https://github.com/nobelh/PID-Enumeration-by-LFI)**.

<h4>The parameter passed to the scripts are:</h4>

**URL:** The web app URL including the vulnerable parameter 
**Max PID Count:** The maximum number of PIDs to try starting from 1
**Proc File:** Name of the file we want to read from inside the PID subdirectory
**Output File:** Name of the output file

<h4>Here's a snippet replicating the attack with Python:</h4>

## Remediation
When used properly, file inclusion is a feature, not a bug. But failing to implement it properly turns it into a critical vulnerability. Some general recommendations developers can use to prevents LFI attacks include:
- Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Never trust user input, and make sure to implement proper input validation against file inclusion
- Implement whitelisting for file names and locations as well as blacklisting
