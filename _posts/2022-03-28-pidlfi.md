In this post, we’ll explore a technique to enumerate Linux processes through a web application vulnerable to LFI (Local File Inclusion).

File inclusion vulnerabilities allow attackers to read arbitrary files from local or remote systems and include the contents of the files in the web server’s response.

## A vulnerable web app
We'll use a simple php script to simulate our vulnerable web application. As shown in the code, the `include` statement is used to copy the contents of a file into the `lfi.php` page.

```php
<?php 
if(isset($_GET['lang'])){
        include($_GET['lang']);
} ?>
```

The following image shows a request/response to our web application, using the vulnerable parameter `lang` to read the `/etc/passwd` file:
